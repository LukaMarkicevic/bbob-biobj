Welcome to the website with supplementary material for the bbob-biobj and bbob-biobj-ext test suites from the [COCO](https://github.com/numbbo/coco) (Comparing Continuous Optimizers) platform. 

It provides visualizations for all 92 bbob-biobj-ext problems introduced in the paper <strong>Using Well-Understood Single-Objective Functions in Multiobjective Black-Box Optimization Test Suites</strong> submitted to <cite>Evolutionary Computation Journal</cite>.

The plots are retrieved from the [bbob-biobj-plots](https://github.com/numbbo/bbob-biobj-plots) GitHub repository.
