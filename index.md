# Supplementary material for the bbob-biobj and bbob-biobj-ext test suites  #
---
Welcome to the website with supplementary material for the bbob-biobj and bbob-biobj-ext test suites from the [COCO](https://github.com/numbbo/coco) (Comparing Continuous Optimizers) platform. 

It provides [function definitions]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link def.md %}) and [visualizations]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link vis.md %}) for all 92 bbob-biobj-ext problems introduced in the paper <strong>Using Well-Understood Single-Objective Functions in Multiobjective Black-Box Optimization Test Suites</strong> submitted to <cite>Evolutionary Computation Journal</cite>. It also shows the [empirical distribution of angles]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link ecdfs.md %}) between the two (estimated) gradients at the best known Pareto set approximations in low dimensions. The [postprossed data page]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link ppdata.md %}) shows the postprocessed results from a comparison among COMO-CMA-ES, SMS-EMOA-DE, and NSGA-II-Matlab.

The plots are retrieved from the [bbob-biobj-plots](https://github.com/numbbo/bbob-biobj-plots) GitHub repository.
